# spotify_gui
A small project I developed for one of my Python courses that will simply display all the details you would see on Spotify. There is also a menu that will allow the user to accomplish different functions with respect to their Spotify account, e.g., adding a song to the queue, creating a playlist, shuffling the queue.
